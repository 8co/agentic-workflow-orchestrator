    Create a new file src/health.ts that exports a function called getHealthStatus().
    It should return an object with: status ('ok' | 'degraded' | 'down'), uptime
    (process.uptime() in seconds), memoryUsage (process.memoryUsage().heapUsed in MB,
    rounded to 2 decimals), timestamp (ISO string), and version (read from package.json
    or default to 'unknown'). Use named exports only. No external dependencies.
